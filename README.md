Three-stage interview framework for a Simulation Research Engineer (Routing) role. Designed to assess open-ended problem solving, analytical depth, statistical reasoning and behavioural alignment through practical evaluation, manual CV screening and calibrated scoring. Built for fairness, clarity and compliance. 


# Simulation Research Engineer (Routing) – Interview Process Design

This past week, I’ve been building out a structured interview process for a **Simulation Research Engineer (Routing)** role, in Fulfilment Simulations teams. 

Working closely with the hiring team, we designed a three-stage process that assesses open-ended problem solving, analytical depth, statistical reasoning, and communication skills, while maintaining fairness, transparency, and consistency throughout.

The focus is not just on technical knowledge, but on demonstrable reasoning ability in ambiguous, real-world scenarios.

## Overall Interview Structure

We agreed on a structured three-stage process, supported by manual screening and a final calibration discussion. The candidate would have to spend 45 mins on analysing/presenting back a data report, prior to interview.

## CV Screening

**Recruiter-led**

All CVs are reviewed manually by the recruiter.

No AI tools are used in filtering or screening applications.

At this stage, we are looking primarily for evidence of:

- Ability to reason about open-ended problems
- Masters / Phd level education (ideally STEM)   
- Experience conducting deep, exploratory analysis  
- Analytical work in industry, research, or academic settings  

We are not screening purely for specific tools or technologies, but rather for demonstrated problem-solving depth - but highlyweighted to higher education backgrounds

## Stage 1 – Remote Assessment

### 30-Minute Hiring Manager Interview

This initial conversation is designed to assess:

- Suitability and motivation for the role  
- Previous analytical experience  
- Evidence of in-depth problem solving  
- Ability to clearly explain technical work  
- High-level structured reasoning  

Candidates are also asked to walk through a past analytical project in detail, explaining:

- The problem  
- The data involved  
- Their methodology  
- Key challenges  
- What they learned  

This stage evaluates communication, analytical depth, and overall alignment.

## Stage 2 – Technical Assessment (120 mins) 

### Part 1 of the interview : Logical Reasoning Interview (1 hour)

**Format:**

- Introduction  
- CV discussion (brief)  
- Case study exercise  
- Candidate questions  

Candidates are presented with an open-ended scenario and asked to explain:

- What data they would request  
- How they would approach the problem  
- How they would structure their thinking  
- How they would handle uncertainty  

Preparation is intentionally minimal to assess real-time reasoning.

Scrorecard: We assess:

- Communication  
- Understanding of the problem  
- Clarity of thought  
- Generating ideas  
- Handling ambiguity  
- Inquisitiveness  
- Ability to receive and incorporate feedback  

---

### Part 2 of the interview: Data Analysis – Presentation (1 hour)

Candidates are sent an exercise in advance and asked to:

- Submit a written report prior to interview  
- Deliver a 10-minute presentation  
- Participate in a technical discussion (30–40 minutes)  

Scorecard: During the discussion, we assess:

- Justification of chosen methodology  
- Statistical understanding  
- Analytical depth  
- Ability to defend decisions logically  
- Openness to feedback  
- Structured communication  

This stage evaluates both technical capability and clarity of explanation in a panel setting.

---

## Stage 3 – Final Assessment (60 mins) 

### Part 1 of the interview: Data Analysis – Written Report (Separate Scoring)

The submitted report is assessed independently using a structured scorecard.

This allows us to evaluate:

- Quality of writing (clarity, structure, readability)  
- Depth and rigour of analysis  
- Logical flow  
- Strength of conclusions  

Separating written and verbal assessments ensures a fair and balanced evaluation.

---

### Part 2: Behavioural / Cultural Fit Interview (1 hour)

A structured competency-based interview assessing:

- Collaboration  
- Ownership  
- Communication style  
- Problem-solving approach  
- Alignment with team values  

This stage ensures both technical capability and team fit are
